                    A pickled cucumber – commonly known as a pickle...
                    <br>– is a usually small or miniature cucumber 
                    <br>that has been pickled in a brine, vinegar, 
                    <br>or other solution and left to ferment. 
                    <br>The fermentation process is executed either by 
                    <br>immersing the cucumbers in an acidic solution or 
                    <br>through souring by lacto-fermentation. Pickled 
                    <br>cucumbers are often part of mixed pickles.
